This project is a React application that fetches top business headlines from India using the News API. It allows users to navigate through pages of news articles with "Previous" and "Next" buttons. The news articles are dynamically rendered in a grid layout, and it includes loading states to manage and display while fetching data. Basic error handling for API requests is also implemented to enhance user experience.
